#Project 1: Forecasting Malaysia COVID-19 Daily Cases Using ARIMA Model
* This is one of my tasks as a research assistant. I have to forecast Malaysia's daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia using Python
* I managed data of COVID-19 during my internship and the daily cases data is from the official Facebook of the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The data from 2/02/2020 until 11/07/2021.
* I presented manual steps to find the parameters of the ARIMA model which are the order of Autoregression model (p), integration (d), and Moving Average (q) model, and used auto.arima() function to find the best model.
